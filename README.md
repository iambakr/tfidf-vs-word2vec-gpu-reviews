## 🎯 TL;DR

- Built an **end-to-end NLP pipeline** to classify 2,989 Amazon GPU reviews into positive/negative sentiment
- **Word2Vec (Skip-gram) significantly outperformed TF-IDF** across all classifiers — validating semantic embedding superiority in domain-specific text
- Best recall for detecting negative reviews: **Word2Vec + XGBoost → 73.5% recall**
- Best balanced performance: **Word2Vec + SVM RBF → F1 = 0.694**
- mRMR feature selection proved more efficient than Mutual Information for TF-IDF pipelines

## 💡 Business Context

The GPU market has undergone rapid transformation driven by crypto mining, pandemic-era gaming demand, and generative AI adoption. For high-ticket, spec-complex products like graphics cards, consumers rely heavily on **online reviews** to bridge the information asymmetry gap.

**The Challenge:** How can manufacturers systematically extract actionable insights from thousands of unstructured reviews to improve products and customer satisfaction?

This research addresses this challenge by comparing two mainstream text representation methods — **TF-IDF** (statistical) vs. **Word2Vec** (semantic) — to determine which better captures consumer sentiment in highly technical product reviews.

---

## 🔬 Research Questions

1. Which text representation method — TF-IDF or Word2Vec — better captures technical, jargon-intensive consumer opinions for sentiment classification?
2. Do different feature selection methods (MI vs. mRMR) produce significant performance differences?
3. What is the optimal combination of text representation and ML classifier for this domain?

### Text Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Standardization** — Lowercase, remove URLs/HTML/emojis/numbers
2. **Tokenization** — Split text into word tokens
3. **Stop Word Removal** — Snowball + SMART dictionaries + domain-specific terms
4. **Lemmatization** — Restore words to base form (e.g., "running" → "run")
5. **Domain Correction** — Map domain abbreviations (e.g., "fp" → "fps")

### Feature Engineering: Two Parallel Approaches

| Approach | Method | Dimensions Tested |
|---|---|---|
| **TF-IDF** + MI Feature Selection | Statistical word importance weighting | 258, 517, 776, 1034, 1292 |
| **TF-IDF** + mRMR Feature Selection | Min-redundancy max-relevance filtering | 258, 517, 776, 1034, 1292 |
| **Word2Vec** (Skip-gram) | Semantic word embedding | 100, 200, 300 |

### Machine Learning Models (4 classifiers × 13 feature sets = 52 configurations)

| Model | Type | Why Selected |
|---|---|---|
| **SVM Linear** | Linear classifier | Baseline for high-dimensional text |
| **SVM RBF** | Non-linear classifier | Explores non-linear decision boundaries |
| **Random Forest** | Bagging ensemble | Robust feature importance analysis |
| **XGBoost** | Boosting ensemble | State-of-the-art gradient boosting |

**Validation:** 10-fold stratified cross-validation × 30 repeats = 300 evaluation rounds per model

## 📈 Key Results

### 🏆 Best Models by Objective

| Objective | Best Configuration | Performance |
|---|---|---|
| **Max Negative Detection** (Recall) | Word2Vec 300d + XGBoost | **Recall = 0.735** |
| **Balanced Performance** (F1) | Word2Vec 300d + SVM RBF | **F1 = 0.694** |
| **Best TF-IDF** (Recall) | mRMR 258d + SVM Linear | Recall = 0.626 |

### Word2Vec vs. TF-IDF Performance Comparison

#### Word2Vec Results (300 dimensions)

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SVM Linear | 0.865 | 0.591 | 0.710 | 0.645 |
| **SVM RBF** | **0.891** | **0.673** | 0.716 | **0.694** |
| Random Forest | 0.892 | 0.686 | 0.690 | 0.688 |
| **XGBoost** | 0.872 | 0.606 | **0.735** | 0.665 |

#### Best TF-IDF Results (MI 258 dimensions)

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| SVM Linear | 0.877 | 0.723 | 0.471 | 0.570 |
| SVM RBF | 0.880 | 0.724 | 0.490 | 0.585 |
| Random Forest | 0.883 | 0.684 | 0.600 | 0.639 |
| XGBoost | 0.846 | 0.549 | 0.619 | 0.582 |

> **Key Finding:** Word2Vec consistently outperformed TF-IDF with **+10-15% higher recall** and **+5-10% higher F1 scores** across all classifiers.

### 📊 Statistical Significance (Friedman + Dunn's Test)

Statistical testing confirmed that the performance differences are **not due to chance**:
- **Recall:** Friedman χ²(51) = 11,827, p < 0.001
- **F1 Score:** Friedman χ²(51) = 9,811.3, p < 0.001

The **statistically top-performing group** (12 models for Recall, 8 for F1) is dominated by Word2Vec configurations, with only mRMR-based TF-IDF at low dimensions qualifying.

## 💼 Business Applications

### 1. Automated Consumer Feedback Analysis
Deploy Word2Vec + SVM RBF/XGBoost as the core engine for **real-time review monitoring** across e-commerce platforms — replacing manual reading with scalable, automated sentiment detection.

### 2. Cross-Platform Market Intelligence
The identified key terms (e.g., "coil whine", "dead arrival", "refund", "RMA") can serve as a **monitoring dictionary** for tracking brand health across:
- CRM systems
- Social media platforms
- Community forums
- Video platform comments

### 3. Product Improvement Insights
Negative review clustering reveals actionable themes:
- **Hardware defects:** "coil whine" (electrical noise)
- **DOA issues:** "dead arrival" (defective on receipt)
- **Thermal concerns:** "temperature", "thermal throttle"
- **Compatibility:** "power supply", "power cable", "case fit"

### 4. Competitive Benchmarking
The framework enables automated comparison of consumer sentiment **across brands** (MSI vs. ASUS vs. GIGABYTE) and **across product tiers** (RTX 4060 vs. 4090).
